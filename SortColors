/**
Description from the Leetcode problem:
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Follow up:
A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

		Algorithm:
			1. Keep three indices low = 1, mid = 1 and high = N and there are four ranges, 1 to low (the range containing 0), low to mid (the range containing 1), mid to high (the range containing unknown elements) and high to N (the range containing 2).
			2. Traverse the array from start to end and mid is less than high. (Loop counter is i)
			3. If the element is 0 then swap the element with the element at index low and update low = low + 1 and mid = mid + 1
			4. If the element is 1 then update mid = mid + 1
			5. If the element is 2 then swap the element with the element at index high and update high = high – 1 and update i = i – 1. As the swapped element is not processed
			6. Print the output array.
